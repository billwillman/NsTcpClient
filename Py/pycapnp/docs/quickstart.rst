.. _quickstart:

Quickstart
===================

This assumes you already have the capnp library installed. If you don't, please follow the instructions at :ref:`Installation <install>` first.

In general, this library is a very light wrapping of the `Cap'n Proto C++ library <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/cxx.html>`_. You can refer to its docs for more advanced concepts, or just to get a basic idea of how the python library is structured.

Load a Cap'n Proto Schema
-------------------------

First you need to import the library::
    
    import capnp

Then you can load the Cap'n Proto schema with::

    import addressbook_capnp

This will look all through all the directories in your sys.path/PYTHONPATH, and try to find a file of the form 'addressbook.capnp'. If you want to disable the import hook magic that `import capnp` adds, and load manually, here's how::

    capnp.remove_import_hook()
    addressbook_capnp = capnp.load('addressbook.capnp')

For future reference, here is the Cap'n Proto schema. Also available in the github repository under `examples/addressbook.capnp <https://github.com/jparyani/pycapnp/tree/master/examples>`_::

    # addressbook.capnp
    @0x934efea7f017fff0;

    const qux :UInt32 = 123;

    struct Person {
      id @0 :UInt32;
      name @1 :Text;
      email @2 :Text;
      phones @3 :List(PhoneNumber);

      struct PhoneNumber {
        number @0 :Text;
        type @1 :Type;

        enum Type {
          mobile @0;
          home @1;
          work @2;
        }
      }

      employment :union {
        unemployed @4 :Void;
        employer @5 :Text;
        school @6 :Text;
        selfEmployed @7 :Void;
        # We assume that a person is only one of these.
      }
    }

    struct AddressBook {
      people @0 :List(Person);
    }

Const values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Const values show up just as you'd expect under the loaded schema. For example::
    
    print addressbook_capnp.qux
    # 123

Build a message
------------------

Initialize a New Cap'n Proto Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've imported your schema, you need to allocate an actual struct from that schema. In this case, we will allocate an `AddressBook`::

    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message()

Notice that we used `addressbook_capnp` from the previous section: `Load a Cap'n Proto Schema`_.

Also as a shortcut, you can pass keyword arguments to the `new_message` function, and those fields will be set in the new message::

    person = addressbook_capnp.Person.new_message(name='alice')
    # is equivalent to:
    person = addressbook_capnp.Person.new_message()
    person.name = 'alice'

List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allocating a list inside of an object requires use of the `init` function::
    
    people = addresses.init('people', 2)

For now, let's grab the first element out of this list and assign it to a variable named `alice`::

    alice = people[0]

.. note:: It is a very bad idea to call `init` more than once on a single field. Every call to `init` allocates new memory inside your Cap'n Proto message, and if you call it more than once, the previous memory is leaked.

Primitive Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all primitive types, from the Cap'n Proto docs:

- Boolean: Bool
- Integers: Int8, Int16, Int32, Int64
- Unsigned integers: UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64
- Floating-point: Float32, Float64
- Blobs: Text, Data

You can assign straight to the variable with the corresponding Python type. For Blobs, you use strings. Assignment happens just by using the `.` syntax on the object you contstructed above::

    alice.id = 123
    alice.name = 'Alice'
    alice.email = 'alice@example.com'

.. note:: Text fields will behave differently depending on your version of Python. In Python 2.x, Text fields will expect and return a `bytes` string, while in Python 3.x, they will expect and return a `unicode` string. Data fields will always a return `bytes` string.

Enums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we'll allocate a length one list of phonenumbers for `alice`::

    alicePhone = alice.init('phones', 1)[0]

Note that even though it was a length 1 list, it was still a list that was returned, and we extracted the first (and only) element with `[0]`.

Enums are treated like strings, and you assign to them like they were a Text field::
    
    alicePhone.type = 'mobile'

If you assign an invalid value to one, you will get a ValueError::

    alicePhone.type = 'foo'
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    ValueError: src/capnp/schema.c++:326: requirement not met: enum has no such enumerant; name = foo

Unions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the most part, you just treat them like structs::

    alice.employment.school = "MIT"

Now the `school` field is the active part of the union, and we've assigned `'MIT'` to it. You can query which field is set in a union with `which()`, shown in `Reading Unions`_

Also, one weird case is for Void types in Unions (and in general, but Void is really only used in Unions). For these, you will have to assign `None` to them::

    bob.employment.unemployed = None 

.. note:: One caveat for unions is having structs as union members. Let us assume `employment.school` was actually a struct with a field of type `Text` called `name`::
    
        alice.employment.school.name = "MIT"
        # Raises a ValueError

    The problem is that a struct within a union isn't initialized automatically. You have to do the following::

        school = alice.employment.init('school')
        school.name = "MIT"

    Note that this is similar to `init` for lists, but you don't pass a size. Requiring the `init` makes it more clear that a memory allocation is occurring, and will hopefully make you mindful that you shouldn't set more than 1 field inside of a union, else you risk a memory leak

Writing to a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you're done assigning to all the fields in a message, you can write it to a file like so::

    f = open('example.bin', 'w+b')
    addresses.write(f)

There is also a `write_packed` function, that writes out the message more space-efficientally. If you use write_packed, make sure to use read_packed when reading the message.

Read a message
-----------------

Reading from a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much like before, you will have to de-serialize the message from a file descriptor::

    f = open('example.bin', 'rb')
    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read(f)

Note that this very much needs to match the type you wrote out. In general, you will always be sending the same message types out over a given channel or you should wrap all your types in an unnamed union. Unnamed unions are defined in the .capnp file like so::

    struct Message {
        union {
          person @0 :Person;
          addressbook @1 :AddressBook;
        }
    }

Reading Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields are very easy to read. You just use the `.` syntax as before. Lists behave just like normal Python lists::

    for person in addresses.people:
        print(person.name, ':', person.email)
        for phone in person.phones:
            print(phone.type, ':', phone.number)

Reading Unions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only tricky one is unions, where you need to call `.which()` to determine the union type. The `.which()` call returns an enum, ie. a string, corresponding to the field name::

        which = person.employment.which()
        print(which)

        if which == 'unemployed':
            print('unemployed')
        elif which == 'employer':
            print('employer:', person.employment.employer)
        elif which == 'school':
            print('student at:', person.employment.school)
        elif which == 'selfEmployed':
            print('self employed')
        print()

Serializing/Deserializing
--------------

Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As shown in the examples above, there is file serialization with `write()`::
    
    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message()
    ...
    f = open('example.bin', 'w+b')
    addresses.write(f)

And similarly for reading::

    f = open('example.bin', 'rb')
    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read(f)

There are packed versions as well::

    addresses.write_packed(f)
    f.seek(0)
    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read_packed(f)

Multi-message files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above methods only guaranteed to work if your file contains a single message. If you have more than 1 message serialized sequentially in your file, then you need to use these convenience functions::

    addresses = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message()
    ...
    f = open('example.bin', 'w+b')
    addresses.write(f)
    addresses.write(f)
    addresses.write(f) # write 3 messages
    f.seek(0)

    for addresses in addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read_multiple(f):
        print addresses

There is also a packed version::

    for addresses in addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.read_multiple_packed(f):
        print addresses

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a convenience method for converting Cap'n Proto messages to a dictionary. This works for both Builder and Reader type messages::

    alice.to_dict()

For the reverse, all you have to do is pass keyword arguments to the new_message constructor::

    my_dict = {'name' : 'alice'}
    alice = addressbook_capnp.Person.new_message(**my_dict)
    # equivalent to: alice = addressbook_capnp.Person.new_message(name='alice')

It's also worth noting, you can use python lists/dictionaries interchangably with their Cap'n Proto equivalent types::

    book = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message(people=[{'name': 'Alice'}])
    ...
    book = addressbook_capnp.AddressBook.new_message()
    book.init('people', 1)
    book.people[0] = {'name': 'Bob'}


Byte Strings/Buffers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is serialization to a byte string available::

    encoded_message = alice.to_bytes()

And a corresponding from_bytes function::

    alice = addressbook_capnp.Person.from_bytes(encoded_message)

There are also packed versions::

    alice2 = addressbook_capnp.Person.from_bytes_packed(alice.to_bytes_packed())


Byte Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This feature is not supported in PyPy at the moment, pending investigation.

Cap'n Proto supports a serialization mode which minimizes object copies. In the C++ interface, ``capnp::MessageBuilder::getSegmentsForOutput()`` returns an array of pointers to segments of the message's content without copying. ``capnp::SegmentArrayMessageReader`` performs the reverse operation, i.e., takes an array of pointers to segments and uses the underlying data, again without copying. This produces a different wire serialization format from ``to_bytes()`` serialization, which uses ``capnp::messageToFlatArray()`` and ``capnp::FlatArrayMessageReader`` (both of which use segments internally, but write them in an incompatible way).

For compatibility on the Python side, use the ``to_segments()`` and ``from_segments()`` functions::

    segments = alice.to_segments()

This returns a list of segments, each a byte buffer. Each segment can be, e.g., turned into a ZeroMQ message frame. The list of segments can also be turned back into an object::

    alice = addressbook_capnp.Person.from_segments(segments)

RPC
----------

Cap'n Proto has a rich RPC protocol. You should read the `RPC specification <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/rpc.html>`_ as well as the `C++ RPC documentation <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/cxxrpc.html>`_ before using pycapnp's RPC features. As with the serialization part of this library, the RPC component tries to be a very thin wrapper on top of the C++ API.

The examples below will be using `calculator.capnp <https://github.com/jparyani/pycapnp/blob/master/examples/calculator.capnp>`_. Please refer to it to understand the interfaces that will be used.

Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting a Client
################

Starting a client is very easy::

    import capnp
    import calculator_capnp

    client = capnp.TwoPartyClient('localhost:60000')

.. note:: You can also pass a raw socket with a `fileno()` method to TwoPartyClient

Restoring
###################

Before you do anything else, you will need to restore a capability from the server. Refer to the `Cap'n Proto docs <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/rpc.html>`_ if you don't know what this means::

    calculator = client.ez_restore('calculator').cast_as(calculator_capnp.Calculator)

There's two things worth noting here. First, we used the simpler `ez_restore` function. For servers that use a struct type as their Restorer, you will have to do the following instead::

    calculator = client.restore(calculator_capnp.MyStructType.new_message(foo='bar')).cast_as(calculator_capnp.Calculator)

Secondly, you see that we are casting the capability that we receive. This is because capabilities are intrinsically dynamic, and they hold no run time type information, so we need to pick what interface to interpret them as.

Calling methods
################

There are 2 ways to call RPC methods. First the more verbose `request` syntax::

    request = calculator.evaluate_request()
    request.expression.literal = 123
    eval_promise = request.send()

This creates a request for the method named 'evaluate', sets `expression.literal` in that call's parameters to 123, and then sends the request and returns a promise (all non-blocking).

The shorter syntax for calling methods is::

    eval_promise = calculator.evaluate({"literal": 123})

The major shortcoming with this method is that expressing complex fields with many nested sub-structs can become very tedious.

Once you have a promise, there are 2 ways of getting to the result. The first is to wait for it::

    result = eval_promise.wait()

The second is to build a promise chain by calling `then`::

    def do_stuff(val):
        ...

    eval_promise.then(do_stuff).wait()

Pipelining
#################

If a method returns values that are themselves capabilites, then you can access these fields before having to call `wait`. Doing this is called pipelining, and it allows Cap'n Proto to chain the calls without a round-trip occurring to the server::

    # evaluate returns `value` which is itself an interface.
    # You can call a new method on `value` without having to call wait first
    read_promise = eval_promise.value.read()
    read_result = read_promise.wait() # only 1 wait call 

You can also chain promises with `then` and the same pipelining will occur::

    read_result = eval_promise.then(lambda ret: ret.value.read()).wait()

Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting a Server
##################

    server = capnp.TwoPartyServer('*:60000', restore)

    server.run_forever()

See the `Restore`_ section for an explanation of what the `restore` object needs to looks like.

.. note:: You can also pass a raw socket with a `fileno()` method to TwoPartyServer. In that case, `run_forever` will not work, and you will have to use `on_disconnect.wait()`.

Implementing a Server
#######################

Here's a part of how you would implement a Calculator server::

    class CalculatorImpl(calculator_capnp.Calculator.Server):

        "Implementation of the Calculator Cap'n Proto interface."

        def evaluate(self, expression, _context, **kwargs):
            return evaluate_impl(expression).then(lambda value: setattr(_context.results, 'value', ValueImpl(value)))

        def defFunction_context(self, context):
            params = context.params
            context.results.func = FunctionImpl(params.paramCount, params.body)

        def getOperator(self, op, **kwargs):
            return OperatorImpl(op)

Some major things worth noting.

- You must inherit from `your_module_capnp.YourInterface.Server`, but don't worry about calling __super__ in your __init__
- Method names of your class must either match the interface exactly, or have '_context' appended to it
- If your method name is exactly the same as the interface, then you will be passed all the arguments from the interface as keyword arguments, so your argument names must match the interface spec exactly. You will also receive a `_context` parameter which is equivalent to the C++ API's Context. I highly recommend having **kwargs as well, so that even if your interface spec is upgraded and arguments were added, your server will still operate fine. 
- Returns work with a bit of magic as well. If you return a promise, then it will be handled the same as if you returned a promise from a server method in the C++ API. Otherwise, your return statement will be filled into the results struct following the ordering in your spec, for example::

    # capability.capnp file
    interface TestInterface {
      foo @0 (i :UInt32, j :Bool) -> (x: Text, i:UInt32);
    }

    # python code
    class TestInterface(capability_capnp.TestInterface.Server):
        def foo(self, i, j, **kwargs):
            return str(j), i

- If your method ends in _context, then you will only be passed a context parameter. You will have to access params and set results yourself manually. Returning promises still works as above, but you can't return anything else from a method.

Restore
###########

Restoring can occur in either a class::

    class SimpleRestorer(test_capability_capnp.TestSturdyRefObjectId.Restorer):

        def restore(self, ref_id):
            if ref_id.tag == 'testInterface':
                return Server(100)
            else:
                raise Exception('Unrecognized ref passed to restore')

    ...

    server = capnp.TwoPartyServer(sock, SimpleRestorer())

Where you inherit from StructType.Restorer, and the argument passed to restore will be cast to the proper type.

Otherwise, restore can be a function::

    def restore(ref_id):
        if ref_id.as_struct(test_capability_capnp.TestSturdyRefObjectId).tag == 'testInterface':
            return Server(100)
        else:
            raise Exception('Unrecognized ref passed to restore')

    ...

    server = capnp.TwoPartyServer(sock, restore)
