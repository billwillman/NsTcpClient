        // capability from its export table. To be on the safe side, 
        // this class also implements a finalizer which will auto-release this capability
        // remotely. This might happen if one forgets to Dispose() a Proxy. It might also happen
        // if no Proxy is ever created. The latter situation occurs if the using client never
        // deserializes the capability Proxy from its RPC state. This situation is nearly
        // impossible to handle without relying on GC, since we never know when deserialization
        // happens, and there is no RAII like in C++. Since this situation is expected to happen rarely, 
        // it seems acceptable to rely on the finalizer. There are three possible states.
        // A: Initial state after construction: No reference, capability is *not* released.
        // B: Some positive reference count.
        // C: Released state: No reference anymore, capability *is* released.
